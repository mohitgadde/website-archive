Greetings! I am Mohitvishnu S. Gadde, but you can call me Mohit. I am currently pursuing Ph.D. in Robotics at the Collaborative Robotics and Intelligent Systems (CoRIS) Institute at Oregon State University; where I am advised by the  Prof. Alan Fern at the Dynamic Robotics and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (DRAIL). My research interest lies in using Reinforcement Learning to create dynamic behaviors based on the first principles of legged locomotion. Here, I focus on developing planning and control strategies for bi-pedal legged robots to traverse over rough terrain. 

Prior to this, I worked as a Research Assistant at the Artificial Intelligence and Robotics Laboratory (AIRL), which was led by Prof. Suresh Sundaram at the Department of Aerospace Engineering at the Indian Institute of Science. Earlier, I was a Project Assistant at the Guidance Control and Descision making Laboratory (GCDSL) headed by Prof. Debashish Ghose at the Department of Aerospace Engineering at the Indian Institute of Science.

I graduated with a Bachelors of Technology (B.Tech) degree in Mechanical Engineering from Rajiv Gandhi University of Knowledge Technologies (RGUKT AP-IIIT), Nuzvid. I previously interened at the UAV lab with Dr. SN Omakr at the Indian Institute of Science.
